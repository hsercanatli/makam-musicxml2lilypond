musicxml2lilypond
===========
Python package that converts the a makam-musicxml score to [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/)

Introduction
------------
This repository provides a simple and reliable conversion of a makam music score from MusicXML format to LilyPond format.

You can obtain 2200 makam music scores in MusicXML format from [SymbTr](http://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu/makam/) collection. Alternatively, you can use the SymbTr-txt files in the collection and generate the MusicXML files with limited modifications using the [MusicXMLConverter](https://github.com/burakuyar/MusicXMLConverter) package.

The LilyPond format and the LilyPond software itself are a powerful combination for music engraving, with vast use cases. Moreover, the software has a rather powerful LilyPond format to svg conversion capability. During conversion it encodes a precise mapping of the musical elements in the LilyPond file onto the generated vectors in the svg file. The scores in svg format created this way (SymbTr conversion "chain" from txt -> MusicXML -> LilyPond -> svg) are currently stored and displayed in the  ["Dunya-makam"](http://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu/makam/) website. The notes and the sections of the resultant svg score files are displayed in the recording page, synchronous to the audio playback.

Usage
------

```python
from musicxml2lilypond.musicxml2lilypond import ScoreConverter

# input MusicXML file
xml_file = "samplescores/pesendide--sazsemaisi--aksaksemai----iii_selim.xml"

# output lilypond file
ly_file = "samplescores/pesendide--sazsemaisi--aksaksemai----iii_selim.ly"

# output json file storing the mappings beteen ly and musicxml files.
map_file = "samplescores/pesendide--sazsemaisi--aksaksemai----iii_selim.json"

# instantiate
converter = ScoreConverter()
ly_stream, mapping = converter.run(xml_file, ly_out=ly_file, map_out=map_file,
                                   render_metadata=False)
```
