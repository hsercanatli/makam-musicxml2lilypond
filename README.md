musicxml2lilypond
===========
Python package that converts the a makam-musicxml score to lilypond

Introduction
------------
This repositry provides a simple and reliable conversion of a
makam music score from MusicXML format to LilyPond format.

You can obtain 2200 makam music scores in MusicXML format from [SymbTr]
(http://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu/makam/) collection. Alternatively you can
use the SymbTr-txt files in the collection and generate a MusicXML file with
different options using the
[MusicXMLConverter](https://github.com/burakuyar/MusicXMLConverter) repository.

The LilyPond format is useful not only it's music engraving capabilities
but also the Lilypond softwares powerful svg conversion as the musical
elements in the Lilypond and svg files are mapped to each other. This
package is currently used in [Dunya-makam](http://dunya.compmusic.upf
.edu/makam/) website in the SymbTr conversion "chain" from txt -> MusicXML
-> LilyPond -> svg. The resultant svg files are displayed in the recording
page synchronous to the audio playback.

This package is in active development. The calls might change drastically
until the first stable release. For this reason we suggest the users to
stick to the released versions, for the most reliable performance.
