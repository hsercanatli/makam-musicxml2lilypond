musicxml2lilypond
===========
Python package that converts a makam score in MusicXml format to [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/)

Introduction
------------
This repository provides a simple and reliable conversion of a makam music score from MusicXML format to LilyPond format.

You can obtain 2200 makam music scores in MusicXML format from [SymbTr](http://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu/makam/) collection. Alternatively, you can use the SymbTr-txt files in the collection and generate the MusicXML files with limited modifications using the [MusicXMLConverter](https://github.com/burakuyar/MusicXMLConverter) package.

The LilyPond format and the LilyPond software itself are a powerful combination for music engraving, with vast use cases. Moreover, when the software convert the LilyPond format to svg, it embeds a precise mapping of the musical elements in the LilyPond file onto the generated vectors in the svg file. In turn, the musical elements in the svg files can be rendered synchronous to the music playback in relevant applications.

Usage
------

```python
from musicxml2lilypond.ScoreConverter import ScoreConverter

# input MusicXML file
xml_file = "samplescores/pesendide--sazsemaisi--aksaksemai----iii_selim.xml"

# output lilypond file
ly_file = "samplescores/pesendide--sazsemaisi--aksaksemai----iii_selim.ly"

# output json file storing the mappings beteen ly and musicxml files.
map_file = "samplescores/pesendide--sazsemaisi--aksaksemai----iii_selim.json"

# instantiate
converter = ScoreConverter()
ly_stream, mapping = converter.convert(
    xml_file, ly_out=ly_file, mapping_out=map_file, render_metadata=False)
```
